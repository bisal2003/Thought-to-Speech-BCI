# Chisco 
This repo is the implementation for "**Chisco: An EEG-based BCI Dataset for Semantic Reconstruction of Imagined Speech**".

The details about the code were mentioned in the paper. 

Chisco 1.1 is on its way. In addition to the 3 participants mentioned in the manuscript, we have now identified other 4 suitable participants. Data from some participants are currently being processed, while data collection is ongoing for others. This will bring the total EEG recording time to 100 hours! We invite you to stay tuned for further developments in our work! The analysis of the additional dataset will be provided as a supplement to the original manuscript and made available here.

The article has been accepted by *Scientific Data*. Detailed information will be added after publication.
