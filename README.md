## Abstract

This report presents a comprehensive investigation into the application of state-of-the-art deep learning architectures for the decoding of imagined speech from electroencephalography (EEG) signals. The ability to accurately interpret neural signals associated with imagined speech represents a monumental step forward in the field of Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs), offering a potential voice to individuals who have lost the ability to speak due to paralysis, such as those with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or locked-in syndrome. This research explores and systematically evaluates a spectrum of neural network models, each chosen for its unique architectural strengths and theoretical promise in handling the complex, high-dimensional, and noisy nature of EEG data.

We begin with foundational signal processing techniques, leveraging Wavelet Transforms to decompose EEG signals into time-frequency representations, which serve as rich feature sets for subsequent classification. We then explore architectures that operate on distinct frequency bands, inspired by the neurophysiological relevance of specific brain rhythms (e.g., alpha, beta, gamma) in cognitive processes. Following this, we delve into the domain of advanced computer vision models, reimagining EEG spectrograms as images to be classified by powerful architectures such as EfficientNet and the Vision Transformer (ViT). These models, renowned for their success in image recognition, are adapted to learn hierarchical features from the structured time-frequency data. 

Finally, we implement and analyze a sophisticated, multi-modal architecture, DeWave, which integrates convolutional layers for spatial feature extraction, a Transformer for capturing temporal dependencies, and a vector quantization module for generating a discrete latent space. Through rigorous training, evaluation, and comparative analysis, this report details the architecture, methodology, and performance of each approach. We present quantitative results, including accuracy metrics and confusion matrices, and provide a qualitative discussion on the strengths, weaknesses, and unique contributions of each model. The findings of this study not only benchmark the performance of these diverse architectures on the Chisco dataset of imagined speech but also illuminate promising research directions for developing practical, high-fidelity BCIs that can restore communication and significantly improve the quality of life for paralyzed individuals.

## Quickstart Example: How Imagined Speech Decoding Works

To help visitors quickly grasp the essence of this project, here's an abbreviated code snippet demonstrating the core workflow: from EEG preprocessing with wavelets to model inference.

```python
import mne
import numpy as np
from pywt import cwt
from models.eegcnn import EEGCNN
from utils import preprocess_eeg, plot_scalogram

# Load example EEG data (Chisco dataset)
raw = mne.io.read_raw_fif('subject1_raw.fif', preload=True)
eeg_data = raw.get_data()  # shape: (n_channels, n_times)

# Preprocessing: Bandpass filter and artifact removal
eeg_data_clean = preprocess_eeg(eeg_data, l_freq=1, h_freq=100)

# Feature Extraction: Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT)
scales = np.arange(1, 128)
wavelet = 'morl'
scalograms = []
for channel in eeg_data_clean:
    coeffs, _ = cwt(channel, scales, wavelet)
    scalograms.append(np.abs(coeffs))
scalograms = np.stack(scalograms)  # shape: (n_channels, n_scales, n_times)

# Visualize a sample scalogram (for Wavelet-ViT approach)
plot_scalogram(scalograms[0])

# Model Inference: Use a trained CNN/ViT to decode imagined speech
model = EEGCNN.load_from_checkpoint('best_model.ckpt')
features = scalograms.reshape(1, scalograms.shape[0], scalograms.shape[1], scalograms.shape[2])
predicted_word = model.predict(features)
print("Decoded Imagined Word:", predicted_word)
```

This snippet illustrates the transformation of raw EEG into a time-frequency representation, visualization for inspection, and classification using a deep learning model. For actual deployment, data augmentation, more complex architectures (ViT, DeWave), and robust cross-validation are applied.

## 2. Wavelet-Based Approaches: Unpacking Time and Frequency

### Brief: Wavelet Featurization for ViT

#### Why Wavelets?

Brain signals contain information at distinct times and frequencies. A simple Fourier Transform cannot capture *when* a frequency occurs; wavelets allow us to see both time and frequency in one representation.

#### The Approach

- **Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT):** Converts a 1D EEG channel into a 2D "scalogram" (time x frequency).
- **Scalogram Construction:** For each channel, CWT produces a matrix. For all channels, we stack them to form a 3D tensor (channels x frequency x time).
- **Feature Engineering:** 
    - **3-Channel:** Magnitude (log-scaled), phase, and magnitude difference for rich, complementary views.
    - **5-Band:** Average magnitude over canonical bands (Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, Gamma).
- **Input to Model:** This tensor is suitable for CNNs or ViT architectures, which can learn spatial and temporal patterns from the scalograms.

#### Example: Wavelet Feature Extraction

```python
from pywt import cwt

def compute_scalogram(eeg_data, scales, wavelet='morl'):
    scalograms = []
    for channel in eeg_data:
        coeffs, _ = cwt(channel, scales, wavelet)
        scalograms.append(np.abs(coeffs))  # Use magnitude for features
    return np.stack(scalograms)  # shape: (channels, scales, times)
```

#### Professional Explanation: Wavelet Featurization

In this project, wavelets are used to extract time-frequency features from the EEG. Unlike traditional spectral decomposition, wavelets provide adaptive resolution, making them ideal for nonstationary signals like EEG. The scalogram encodes how energy at different frequencies evolves over time, forming a rich basis for deep learning models. For ViT, these scalograms are treated as imagesâ€”the patches correspond to regions of the time-frequency map, and self-attention mechanisms can relate distant events in time or frequency. The approach enables nuanced decoding of imagined speech, capturing both transient bursts and sustained oscillations that might encode cognitive intent.
