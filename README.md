# Chisco 
This repo is the implementation for "**Chisco: An EEG-based BCI Dataset for Semantic Reconstruction of Imagined Speech**".

The details about the code were mentioned in the paper. 

In addition, chisco 1.1 is on its way. In addition to the 3 subjects mentioned in the paper, we have added data from more subjects and used the same experimental paradigm. After the preprocessing is completed, we will put the data links here.
