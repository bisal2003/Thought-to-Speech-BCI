i need to replicate this chisco paper for further study, say i have this already downloaded this derivative folder with only preprocessed_pkl folder in in, so i need to start with the preprocessed file only so simplify the above code structure but do not lost the actual target , and giv eme proper steps and guide so that i can replicate the above paper with proper classification and accuracy output

well then update the eeg5bands.py , EEGclassify5bands.py,wavelets_5bands.py ,like this architexture nothing else:
1.the signal from the pkl file is processed via wavelets straight forward into 20 band from 0 to 100 ,
2.the intension is that within the freq band from 0-4 is delta,4-8 is thete,8-12 is alpha,12-32 is beta, 32-100 gamma, and the like 4 4 group and for beta and gamma just get the average of that 4 - 4 bands in between then no other operation like abs or mean any thing
3, then feed them to cnn like 5 bands(like R G B) * 125 channels * 1651 time stamp or so,
4. then to the transformer and so on,
5. decide the batch according to your knowledge for first computation using GPU
6.save the model at every epochs so that i can retrain it if needed, or i can save the parameters if connection lost,
7.Write all the code precisely with proper comment so that anyone can understand it and simple code


well then ok , give me a better overlook to the architexture of Chisco paper, like input and output dimension at every step


well tell me the architexture of this transformer like each step and how it process the data at each step, with its intension behind it
